Abstract: To render a wearable robot imperceptible to a user is a very challenging
control task. The constant and intrinsic interaction between robot and human,
and person-dependent behaviours are the main difficulties when designing such
cooperative control. In this contribution we introduce and discuss a novel and
promising transparency control framework. The foundation of the framework is to
measure the acceleration of the human limbs and to exploit this measurement to
generate feedforward control commands by using a rigid body model of the robot.
The framework includes also an acceleration feedback controller and a state
estimator to enhance the overall performance. We present a simplified stability
analysis with different feedback controllers and preliminary experimental
data that demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in reducing interaction
forces and mimicking human motions.
